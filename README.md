## Project goals 
The paper replicates the research conducted in the article titled "From Reddit to Wall Street: The role of committed minorities in financial collective action" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07361.pdf), authored by Lorenzo Lucchini, Luca Maria Aiello, Laura Alessandretti, Gianmarco De Francisci Morales, Michele Starnini, and Andrea Baronchelli in 2021. 
    This replication project involves the comprehensive analysis of data from Reddit and financial markets to investigate the mechanisms by which commited individuals initiate cascading behaviors in financial markets and social networks, using Reddit data and GameStop stock data. In the context of this work, we conducted a comparative analysis between the findings obtained in the current research project and those presented by the authors in the referenced article.
